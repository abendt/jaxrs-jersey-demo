JAX-RS(Jersey)/Tomcat sample application
========================================

this is a collection of sample applications that show how
a JAX-RS application can be set up using
* Tomcat7 as target container
* Jersey as JAX-RS implementation
* Arquillian to do in-container tests
* Spock as an alternate way to test
* Spring or CDI to use dependency injection

Have a look at the different modules.
